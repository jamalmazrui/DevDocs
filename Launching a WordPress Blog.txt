Definition of WordPress: WordPress is an open-source blogging and content management system (CMS) platform used by millions of individuals and businesses.   
  
WordPress Introduction 
WordPress is no doubt...a game changer.  Started in 2003 by Matt Mullenweg, WordPress has quickly become the world's most popular content management system (CMS) platform. Some of the largest companies in the world such as Pepsi, Samsung and Ford use WordPress as their software to operate their sites.  Nowadays, I don't know too many people who don't start a site using WordPress.   
 
By now you might be wondering why WordPress is preferred by individuals and companies.  The short answer is easy; it's free and easy to use.   
 
Benefits of WordPress 
WordPress Can Be Adapted to Almost Any Type of Site  
The magic of WordPress is that it can easily be installed to work with any type of site.  Whether you have a personal blog, business or e-commerce site; WordPress can be the backened of your site.  Once setup, you will then be able to easily update content, add plugins, share your content with social media tools, and get noticed by Google and more.  Your audience will see the theme (front-end) design and only you, or assigned administrators, will be able to log into the dashboard (back-end). Easily update content 
The most beneficial aspect of WordPress is allowing non-technical individuals to easily work the content of the site. Once setup and configured, the owner of the site can make changes to the pages with as little as a few 
clicks of the mouse. There is no need to navigate through endless code to find the page you need to update.  If you know how to use Microsoft Word, you will know how to add, delete and update your own website. 
Search Engine Friendly 
The way WordPress is organized and structured makes it friendly for search engines such as Google and Yahoo! to recognize it. Traffic from search engines is crucial to your website because it's free and the visitors tend to be more loyal because they are looking for something specific. 
Themes & Plugins 
There are thousands of free and premium templates and plugins available for WordPress with hundreds created each day. I tend to stay away from free themes but premium themes, that are customized, give companies a unique look with half the cost. Plugins are features you download for your blog. There are literally thousands of them that range from a shopping cart system to a poll. The combination of both a customized theme and innovative plugins allow for a great-looking functional site. 
Here to Stay 
Some CMS software eventually disappears from the market, not WordPress. I don't think it's too bold of a prediction to state that WordPress will go nowhere as long as the internet exists. There are over 25 million sites powered by WordPress, these include some major public companies. 
Cost Effective  
WordPress allows for individuals and businesses to display thoughts, service and/or products without breaking the bank. You can easily succeed in obtaining an expensive look for a fraction of the cost.  Using a premium theme that is customized can save you thousands...literally.  Our custom designs start at $1,200 but I know companies who charge $50,000-$75,000 per website.  The money you save with your new website can be invested elsewhere such as advertising.

Types of Sites you Can Create 
When it comes to WordPress, there is not much you can't do.  It started as a blogging platform but has extended itself into being able to fully function as other types of sites.  WP is pretty much limitless in terms of creating a site other than a blog.   
 
I do have to say though, as blogging software, WordPress is hands down the best compared to its competitors such as Joomla and Typepad.   
 
Let's dig deep into what types of sites WordPress can accomplish for you.  Below are the types of sites you can create with an install of WP.   
 
Blogs 
 
 
 

 
Corporate/Business Sites 
 
  
Gallery/Portfolio Sites 
 
| 
Web & Mobile Apps Sites 
 
Restaurant Sites

News Sites 
 
 
And more...

Installing & Configuring WordPress 
If your new to the WordPress game and have never setup a site before then this step by step tutorial will walk you through it.  I've installed and designed over 100+ WordPress sites for myself and others and it is super easy after you get a few under your belt.   
This tutorial is assuming you are starting from scratch and all you have is an idea lodged in your head or written down on paper.  
 
Basic Steps to creating a WordPress based site 
1. Register domain name    
2. Register hosting 
3. Install a clean version of WordPress 
4. Point nameservers to hosting 
5. Change password for WordPress login 
6. Find and upload a theme 
7. Install and configure plugins 
8. Customize theme 
9. Create Pages 
10. Setup menus 
11. Configure SEO using a plugin 
12. Go live with your site 
 
 
1.  Register domain name 
Today, registering a domain name is extremely easy and affordable.  I register all of my domain names with Namecheap.  I haven't had any problems with them and they seem to have the best prices and customer support in the industry. Before you register a domain name, make sure you Google for a coupon code; you can usually save a few dollars. 
 
If at all possible, I would try to register a .com first.  If that is not available a .net is the second best.  Also, I would try to stay away from hyphenated domain names. Not only are they more difficult to remember but domain 
names without hyphenated domain names will outrank you in the search engines. 
 
 
2.  Register with a hosting company 
I always suggest to my clients to go with Host Gator, they have been great to me over the years.  Their plans start at $3.96 per month and they offer a variety of solutions.  For the purpose of this tutorial I will be using Host Gator. 
Use promo code "WordPressKube" and receive the first month for just 1 cent!  
 
Once signed up you will be assigned a cPanel (hosting control panel) user and password.  This is very important, so keep it handy as we will be using it in the next couple steps. 
Note: During the signup process, you will be asked your domain name.  Use the domain name you registered with NameCheap.   
 
 
3.  Install a clean version of WordPress 
The beauty of Host Gator is that they offer one click installs for WordPress and other open-source platforms. 
 
The second step to installing WordPress on your host is to log into cPanel.  Here you will be redirected to the dashboard.  Scroll down to "Software/Services" and click "QuickInstall."  Now you will need to click "WordPress" on the left menu and enter all of the relevant information.  After you hit "Install Now" you will be given a password to your new 
WordPress site.  Keep this handy but you should also be sent an email with it also.

4.  Point Nameservers to hosting 
Now you won't see your site up and running just yet.  You have to tell your domain name that you found a new home (hosting company).  In order to do so you have to set up your nameservers to point to your new hosting company. 
Finding Nameservers 
on the left menu of the cPanel dashboard (bottom), you should see your nameservers.  They look like "ns1234.hostgator.com" and "ns1235.hostgator.com.  Of course these are made up and you should not use them but the one's assigned to you look very similar. 
 
Setting Nameservers 
after you have found your nameservers, you will need to point them to your server.  To do so, log in to your Namecheap account and find "Nameservers" in the menu and then enter your specific nameservers from the above. 
 
 
It will take some time to update your records so you won't see your site up right away.  It states that it could take up to 2 hours but from my experience, it usually takes less than 45 minutes.   

 
5.  Login and change your password 
After you set your nameservers to your hosting company, you will now see your site live with the default WordPress theme called, Twenty Eleven. 
 
You should receive an email confirmation when you successfully installed WordPress with your site login.  By default WordPress sets your login extension as "wp-admin" so your site login will look like http://yoursite.com/wp-admin. 
 
You will need to enter a username, which is usually "admin" and password (both given in email confirmation).  After you have successfully login the page that you see is called the WordPress Dashboard, you will be able to almost anything from this screen. 
 
Our first order of business is to change your password something you set so you can login without any interruptions next time. 
 
On the top right side of your WP Dashboard, you will something like "Howdy, 
Devesh." Click "Edit Profile" and enter in the new password then click "Update Profile." 
 
If you are concerned or have pointed to people to your new URL beforehand you can install a plugin that will act as a Coming Soon (link) page. 
  
Get familiar with the WP Dashboard as this is the central place where you will do everything including create posts and pages, add categories, install and delete plugins, configure plugin settings, switch themes, etc.   
 
 
 
6.  Find and Upload a new theme 
WordPress uses a templating system for its front end.  You can install a theme from your Dashboard and once activated, visitors will see that theme in action. 
 
There are literally thousands of free and premium WordPress themes available.  I try to stick to premium themes because they usually have better documentations, a community for help, better coding, etc.  Also, for the most part, premium themes offer free updates to fix any issues that have been found. 
 
Where to find themes 
 
I've worked with countless WordPress template's over the years and below I've listed the one's I found to be the best. 
 
Elegant Themes:  Elegant Themes is a premium affordable theme shop that sells 75+ themes + 4 Premium Plugins for just $39 a year. The ElegantThemes showcases some of the best designed WordPress themes available. 
 
 
Genesis: A premium theme framework by the CopyBlogger media. Genesis is one of the popular and affordable theme frameworks for WordPress.  
I'm using it on my Social Media Blog - BlogPreneurs. 
 
Thesis: This theme framework is one of the best premium themes available for WordPress. It is a great out of the box solution with design options in the admin dashboard. 
Thesis is the theme and framework that WordPress Kube runs on.  
 
Theme Forest:  Theme Forest is a marketplace where a number of great designers submit their WordPress themes available to be purchased by the public.  You can find all types of themes for different types of sites.  I've purchased over thirty themes here and I'm always impressed with the new one's that come out. 
 
Woo Themes: is a company who specializes in creating eyepleasing themes with great coding.  Promising two themes per month, these are the best of the best.  In addition to buying themes separately, you can also become a member and get access to all of them! 
 
Find the best one that suite the type of site you're going for and either purchase or download it to your computer.  It will most likely come with documentation on how to install it and make the necessary changes to get it to work correctly. 
 
Upload your theme 
The next step is to upload and activate your new theme.  Again, WordPress makes it easy to install themes from the Dashboard.  All you have to do is find "Appearance" in the menu and click "Themes" then click the tab "Install Theme."  On the screen you can search free themes or upload a theme from your computer.   After you have uploaded your new theme, click "Install

Now" and your new theme should be ready for activation.  If you are getting an error, refer to the site or documentation inside the file to assist you. 
7.  Install Plugins 
Plugins help you create features of your site without any coding work.  There are literally hundreds of plugins available for WordPress.  You can view all the free plugins in the official WordPress directory 
(http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/)  
You can also search & install available plugins from your WP dashboard.   
 
Here is a list of basic WordPress plugins that are necessary to get started: 
Akismet: This is the spam filter for comments on your site.  Without this you could receive hundred of spam solicitors per day! 
WordPress SEO: This plugin optimizes your site, pages and posts for search engines.  You can manually enter the title, description, keywords of each post you write!   
Digg Digg: Digg digg is a very cool plugin that allows you to add float social media buttons in your articles. It's an all in one social media solution for a WordPress blog. 
Contact Form 7: A free and beginner friendly contact form solution for WordPress sites. All of our contact forms are powered by Contact Form 7. 
nRelate Related Content: The best way to display related content: Thumbnails or Text, on all your pages. 
Backup Buddy: This plugin allows you to backup your core WordPress database. 
W3 Total Cache: W3 Total Cache is the most complete Website performance solution for WordPress. It improves the user experience of your site by tweaking the performance of your servers and caching the every element of your site. 
WP Touch: As more and more people accessing sites or blogs from their smartphones / tablets, it's very important to have your site optimized for mobile devices.

8.  Customizing your theme 
In this tutorial, it is difficult to tell you how to customize a theme.  Some themes, like Thesis and Genesis, come with features that allow you to structure and style your site through the dashboard. 
As time goes on, I'll have many tutorials on how to customize a theme on my blog.   
 
9.  Create Pages 
In WordPress the two main content types are Pages and Posts.  Pages are more static content such as an about page or Contact page.  These pages are more likely to be found in the navigation bar and are less likely to change over time. Posts are dynamic content that are constantly being updated to show in chronological order. 
In this step, it's important to start off by creating pages so that we can set the menu in the following step. 
10.  Setup Menus 
A neat thing about the 3rd version of WordPress is the menu system.  WordPress allows you to set up your own menus with specific pages, categories or custom URL's.  In order to do this, you need to go to 
"Appearances" then "Menus" and then set specific pages to show up on your main navigation.  Also note that some themes come with more than one navigation area.

11.  Setup permalinks & basic SEO 
Setting Permalinks: By default WordPress assigns its post and pages a unique identifier.  So, out-of-the-box your URL would look http://www.example.com/?p=10.  This should be changed so that bots and your visitors can clearly understand the url of each post.  You would want to change your URL to look like: http://example.com/post-name.  Do you see how much better that is to identify.  In order to change the permalinks you need to go to Settings->Permalinks. In this menu, you would want to change your permalink to "Post name" or "Custom Structure" w/ /%postname%/ (below).

Configuring All in One SEO 
WordPress SEO plugin optimizes your WordPress site for search engines.  It allows search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing to display the title of your post and a description for people searching on your terms.   
 
 
In order to configure it correctly, I've described below a description of each field in the plugin. 
Title Template: This is also known at the meta title on your homepage.  This info can be seen at the top of browsers.  Simply put, it's what your site is about (also known as the tagline).  Make sure it is readable by a human and don't overdo it with keywords.  Don't forget to keep it under 60 characters; anything over the 60 character limit will not be shown. 
Meta Description Temple: This is also known as the meta description of your site.  The meta description is the snippet you see in search engine's.  An important rule here is to add valuable keywords pertaining to your site.  This might be difficult as you have a 160 character limit. 
Meta Keywords: Google doesn't crawl for keywords anymore so this might not be as important as it was a few years ago but it can't hurt to add them.  Create a list of keywords that relate to your site and add them.   Add commas to separate each keyword or keyword phrase. 
Other Settings: Eliminate the Home title (%blog_title%) from your post and page titles.  You don't need this plus it leaves you less room for you actual post or page title; which is more valuable in your SEO efforts. 
**At this point, if you installed the Coming Soon plugin, make sure you deactivate it or your site will not be live. 
 
12.  Your site is ready to go  
Congrats!  Your site is now live and ready for you to take to the next level.  I will share many more WordPress tutorials on my site, wpkube.com. In addition to WordPress related articles, I will be sharing traffic generation and social media tips at BlogPreneurs.  The combination of these two elements is essential to creating a very thriving site.   
I hope this tutorial was helpful in creating a new WordPress site for you.  There is a lot more you can do with WordPress that meets the beginner's eye.  Once you establish the foundation of creating a WP site the rest can be adapted through experience and reading up on tutorials.  Head over to WordPress Kube to read more in depth articles pertaining to the great software known as WordPress. 

c           Quick Tips For New WordPress site owners 
 
 Make sure you update the WordPress core and plugins to its latest version.   
 Simple is key.  Layout your content and advertisements in an organized fashion. 
 Backup your files and database on a regular basis. 
 If you are creating a blog, pick a topic you have an interest in and passionate about.  I see too many blogs fizzle because the owner wasn't interested in the topic. 
 Realize that success is not achieved overnight...or 6 months...or even a year. 
 Be part of your community.  In order have a site that people trust, you need to build personal relationships within your community. 
 Write for your readers not search engines.  Write in-depth articles that your readers will be interested in. 
 Take risks.  A great way to stand out is to do something that isn't be done currently.   
 Be social.  Even though it's not essential at first, sign up for Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus so that your visitors can connect with you outside your blog.   
 Have fun with your new site.  If you feel like you're getting stuck or frustrated with something take it out on me (dev@wpkube.com) and I'll be more than happy to help you out.
