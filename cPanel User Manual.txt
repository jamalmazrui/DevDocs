Apache Handlers  
What are Apache Handlers? Apache handlers allow you to control what Apache will do with certain file types. When Apache sees a file, it has an action built in for that file type, and will perform that action. If you wish Apache to do a different action, you will need to make a handler to tell Apache to perform that action. For example, if you use a file type that requires a special service to run it, such as a file with server side includes that is not named with a .shtml extension, you need to tell Apache to treat these files differently. More information on Apache's Handlers can be found at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/handler.html. 
 
Creating An Apache Handler 
 
1. Enter the handler you want to create in the first empty text box. 
 
2. In the second empty text box, enter the extension the handler will use when being called. 
 
3. Click on the "Add" button. 
Cron Jobs  
Cron jobs allow you to automate certain commands or scripts on your server to complete repetitive tasks automatically. A cron job allows you to run a certain command at times set by the job. For example, you could set a cron job to delete temporary files every week so that your disk space is not being used up by those files.  
Warning! It is important that you familiarize yourself with how cron jobs work. You need to have a good knowledge of Linux commands before you can use cron jobs effectively, especially when using the "Advanced (Unix Style)." Check your script with your hosting administrator before adding a cron job. 
 
cPanel includes two ways to create cron jobs for your web hosting account: 
 
• Standard - GUI based for beginners or users who are not familiar with Linux commands. 
• Advanced (Unix Style) - Command line style of creating cron jobs. You should have experience creating cron jobs on the command line before using this feature. 
 
Before you get started, please view the following web pages to learn more about Cron Jobs: 
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron (Basic) http://www.unixgeeks.org/security/newbie/unix/cron-1.html (Advanced) 
 
Using The Standard GUI 
 
1. Click on the "Standard" button. 
 
2. The first option request that you enter the email address where you want the output of your cron job files to be sent. Enter the email address in the text box provided. 
 
3. By default, "Entry 1" will be available to you. The first option is "Command to run." Enter the command or path to a script/file you want to run in the text box. 
 
4. Below the "Command to run" are five options for setting the time and frequency your cron job will run: 
 
• Minute(s) 
• Hours(s) 
• Days(s) 
• Month(s) 
• Weekday(s) 
 
Select from each of the categories accordingly. 
 
5. Next, click on the "Save Crontab" to create the cron job entry. Or if you want to reset the modifications you have made back to the default settings, click on the "Reset Changes" button. 
 
6. A confirmation page will be shown stating "Cron Updated!" Click on the "Go Back" button to return to the main Cron Job screen. 
 
Using the Advanced (Unix Style) Option 
 
1. Click on the "Advanced (Unix Style) Option" button. 
 
2. The first option request that you enter the email address where you want the output of your cron job files to be sent. Enter the email address in the text box provided. 
 
3. Next, enter the Minute, Hour, Day, Month, Weekday and Command in the text boxes provided. 
 
4. Next, click on the "Save Crontab" to create the cron job entry. Or if you want to reset the modifications you have made back to the default settings, click on the "Reset Changes" button. 
 
6. A confirmation page will be shown stating "Cron Updated!" Click on the "Go Back" button to return to the main Cron Job screen. 
Error Pages  
With this tool you can create custom error pages to display when a user enters a wrong URL, an outdated URL or when the user is not authorized to access a specific directory of your web space.  
 
"Error Pages" consists of the following five types of errors: 
 
• 400 (Bad Request) 
• 401 (Authorization required) 
• 403 (Forbidden) 
• 404 (Wrong page) 
• 500 (Internal server error) 
 
To customize the error page, you can click on the error page number (400, 401, 403, 404, 500) or the error page name (Bad Request, Authorization required, etc). 
 
When the page loads, you have the following six tags available: 
 
Available Tags 
 
• Referring URL - Displays the url of the web site the visitor was previously viewing. 
• Visitor's IP Address - Displays the IP address of the visitor viewing the error page. 
• Requested URL - Displays the intended url the visitor is trying to view. 
• Server name - Displays the web site's server name. 
• Visitor's browser - Displays the visitor's browser type such as IE, FireFox, Netscape, etc. 
• Redirect Status Code - This displays the type of code in the 300-307 range. To learn more about Redirection Status Code, visit the WikiPedia web page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes. 
 
You do not have to use any of the above tags. They are available to you based on your own personal preferences and needs specific to your web site. 
 
You can place any html code or text in the error page specific to your own personal preferences and needs specific to your web site. 
 
Once you have customized your error page, you will notice the "Save as" option text box. The "Save as" option will default to the number you chose with the additional of an .shtml extension. For example, if you chose 400, it would appear as 400.shtml. You can modify this name to code you want. Only modify this to an error that you know will be shown on your web site. 
 
Tip: You can find what error codes are being shown to your visitors by viewing any of the available web site statistical analysis programs built in to cPanel such as Awstats, Webalizer, etc. 
 
Click on the "Save" button. 

Frontpage Extensions  
Frontpage Extensions allow you to publish your site directly from the FrontPage application. This means that you will not have to upload files through FTP, or another method. 
 
Warning! Installing or uninstalling Frontpage Extensions will result in the loss of all ".htaccess" files in your web area. Any changes you have made to your ".htaccess" files will be lost. Any directories you have protected with WebProtect will become unprotected until you re-protect them. 
 
When the page loads, you will see a table containing the following information, split into three columns: 
 
• Domain - This column will show all the domain you have associated with your web hosting account. 
• Status - This column will show the status of FrontPage Extensions installation for the domain in reference. There will be two status labels displayed: 
• installed - This means FrontPage extensions have been installed on the domain in reference. 
• not installed - This means FrontPage extensions have not been installed on the domain in reference. 
• Functions - This column provides two buttons that change according to the Status of the domain in reference. For example, if FrontPage extensions are installed for a domain, the two buttons that will be displayed are as follows: 
 
Reinstall Extensions - This button appears if you already have FrontPage extensions installed for the domain in reference. Click this button to reinstall FrontPage extensions. Occasionally FrontPage extensions may not work properly. If you run into this problem, use this button to reinstall the extensions. 
 
Uninstall Extensions - This button appears if you already have FrontPage extensions installed for the domain in reference. Click this button to uninstall FrontPage extensions. 
 
If the Status for the domain in reference shows "not installed," the two buttons that will be displayed are as follows: 
 
Install Extensions - This button appears if you do not already have FrontPage extensions installed for the domain in reference. Click this button to install FrontPage extensions. 
 
Cleanup Old Extensions - This button appears if you do not already have FrontPage extensions installed for the domain in reference. If you have previously installed and uninstalled FrontPage extensions for the domain in reference, use this button to wipe the domain's account clean of any FrontPage extensions that may have been left behind during the removal of the FrontPage extensions. 
 

Image Manager  
cPanel 11 includes an Image Manager that allows you to view and modify images in your account. You can change the size of your images, convert their file type, or just view them with the Image Manager. 
 
When using the Image Tools available in the Image Manager, you have three options: 
 
• Thumbnailer - The Thumbnailer allows you to view a small (thumbnail sized) version of any images in a directory on your site. 
• Image Scaler - The Image Scaler allows you to change the size of an image on your site. 
• Convert Image Format (jpg,gif,bmp,etc) - The Convert Image Format function allows you to change the format of an image to another file type. Such as changing a .jpg to a .bmp. 
 
Using The Thumbnailer 
 
1. Click on the "Thumbnailer" link in the Image Tools section of Image Manager. 
 
2. A list of your web hosting account's home directory will be shown. You can navigate your way to the directory you want to "thumbnail" by clicking on the folder icon next to the directory name associated with the path to the directory you want to view. 
 
3. When you find the directory you want to thumbnail, click on the directory's name, not the folder icon. 
 
4. When the page loads, you will see two "Scale Percent" text boxes. Both text boxes default to 25%. You can modify the percentage to your personal preferences. 
 
5. The next option is the "Keep Aspect Ratio" checkbox. This option is checked by default. If you leave it checked, cPanel will maintain the correct proportional sizing of the images in the directory you are thumbnailing. If you uncheck this option, it will use both values in the "Scale Percent" text boxes described in Step 4 above. 
 
Note: If the "Keep Aspect Ratio" checkbox is checked, the second "Scale Percent" text box will automatically change according to the value in the first "Scale Percent" text box once you tab over. 
 
6. Next you will have two buttons available: "Thumbnail Images" and "Reset Dimensions" 
 
If you are ready to view the thumbnail images in the director you have chosen, click on the "Thumbnail Images" button. 
 
If you are want to reset the default dimensions (what you previously set), click on the "Reset Dimensions" button. 
 
Using The Image Scaler 
 
1. Click on the "Image Scaler" link in the Image Tools section of Image Manager. 
 
2. A list of your web hosting account's home directory will be shown. You can navigate your way to the directory containing the images you want to scale or find a single image you want to scale. Once you find the directory or a single image you want to scale, click on the directory name or the file name to load the "Image Scaler." 
 
3. The "Image Scaler" provides a great deal of information to you. First you will notice a statement similar to the following: 
 
"We will be scaling /path/to/your/directory or filename/." 
 
If the directory or filename is not correct, click on the "Go Back" link and start with Step 1 above. If the directory or filename is correct, move on to Step 4 below. 
 
4. Next you will see the "Current Dimensions" shown for the image(s) you are scalilng. 
 
Example: Current Dimensions: 16 x 16 
 
Below the "Current Dimensions" will be two pairs of text boxes. The first pair of text boxes shows the "New Dimensions" for your image. In our example, the "New Dimensions" text boxes will have 16 and 16, respectively. The second pair of text boxes shows the "Percent" and defaults to 100 and 100, respectively. 
 
Before we continue, notice the "Keep Aspect Ratio" checkbox below the "New Dimensions" option. The "Keep Aspect Ratio" is checked by default. If this is checked and you modify the first "New Dimensions" text box and then tab over, it will change the second "New Dimensions" text box and the pair of "Percent" text boxes, respectively. Using this option will keep the same aspect ratio of your original image without distorting the image when you scale it down. If you want to modify the dimensions and or percentage manually, without the "Keep Aspect Ratio" option checked, click on the checkbox to turn the feature off. 
 
Keep in mind the "Percent" text boxes will automatically be adjusted whether you have the "Keep Aspect Ratio" option checked or unchecked. Or if you adjust the "Percent" text boxes first and then place your cursor in any of the other text boxes, the "New Dimensions" text boxes will change accordingly. Play around with the settings until you feel comfortable modifying the images. 
 
5. After you have adjusted the "New Dimensions" and "Percent" values in Step 4 above, the next option is the "Retain a copy of the old image as." The checkbox for this option is automatically checked by default. If this option is checked, cPanel will create a copy of the original image and its original size. A copy of the image will be placed in the path shown below the "Retain a copy of the old image as" option. The system automatically defaults the path to the current directory your original image is located and adds the prefix "old-" to your image's original name. 
 
6. Once you have made all the adjustments to your image(s) or the directory of images in the "Image Scaler," click on the "Scale Image" button to proceed with the modifications. Or if you want to reset the dimensions back to their original state (display only), click on the "Reset Dimensions" button. 
 
7. A confirmation page will be shown stating: 
 
"Your image path/to/your/image/ has been scaled to the new dimensions 
YOUR_NEW_DIMENSIONS." 
 
8. Click on the "Go Back" link to return to the "Image Tools" section. 
 
Using The Convert Image Format (jpg,gif,bmp,etc) 
 
1. Click on the "Convert Image Format (jpg,gif,bmp,etc)" link in the Image Tools section of Image Manager. 
 
2. A list of your web hosting account's home directory will be shown. You can navigate your way to the directory containing the images you want to convert or find a single image you want to convert. Once you find the directory or a single image you want to convert, click on the directory name or the file name to load the "Convert Image Format (jpg,gif,bmp,etc)." 
 
3. When the page loads you will see the following statement: 
 
"We will be converting/path/to/your/image/." 
 
Below the statement is a drop down menu containing the following options: 
 
• Portable Network Graphic (png) 
• Jpeg (jpg) 
• Gif (gif) 
• Bitmap (bmp) 
 
Select the image type you want to use for the conversion. For example, if your image is currently a .gif and you want to convert it to a .jpg, select "Jpeg (jpg)" from the drop down menu. 
 
4. Once you  have made your selection from the drop down menu, click on the "Convert" button. 
 
5. The next screen will show a status of your image's conversion. Below the text box will state "Your images have been converted." once the process is done. 
 
6. Click on the "Go Back" link to return to the "Image Tools" section. 
 
 

Index Manager  
The Index Manager allows you to customize the way a directory will be viewed on the web. You can select between a default style, no indexes, or two types of indexing. If you do not wish for people to be able to see the files in your directory, choose no indexing. 
 
Getting To The Index Manager 
 
To get to the Index Manager, click on the "Index Manager" link in the "Advanced" section of your cPanel dashboard. 
 
Navigating The Index Manager 
 
When the page loads, you will see a list of subdirectories available in your root directory. Each directory includes a folder icon and the directory name. If you click on the folder icon next to the directory name, it will descend into the associated directory. For example, if you click on the folder icon next to the "public_html" directory link name, you will automatically be redirected to a list of subdirectories (if available) for the public_html directory. Once inside the public_html directory, or any other subdirectory,  you will also see the "Up One Level" folder icon. Click on the folder icon to go back to the previous directory. 
 
Customizing A Directory Using The Index Manager 
 
In this example we are demonstrating how to customize the public_html directory. The public_html directory is where all your website files are located (subdirectories included). 
 
1. Assuming you are in the root level directory, click on the "public_html" link. 
 
2. When the page loads, you will see the following four options: 
 
• Default System Setting - This option displays a list of directories and files for the associated directory. 
• No Indexing - This option displays a blank page to keep visitors from moving through your directory tree.  
• Standard Indexing (text only) - This option displays a list of directories and files for the associated directory as text based only. 
• Fancying Indexing (graphics and text) - This option displays a list of directories and files for the associated directory using graphics and text. 
 
Note: Click on the navigation link below the "Save" button under the options shown above to return to your previous location. 
 
3. Click on the radio button next to the option you want to choose as described in Step 2 above. 
 
4. Click on the "Save" button. 
 
5. You should see a statement similar to the following: 
 
Index Settings Updated! 
 
The index settings on  DIRECTORY_YOU_CHOSE  have been updated. Indexes are now OPTION_YOU_CHOSE_IN_STEP_3_ABOVE. 

MIME Types  
What are MIME Types? MIME Types tell browsers how to handle specific file extensions. For example, the text/html MIME Types equates to .htm, .html, and .shtml extensions on most servers, telling your browser to interpret all files with those extensions as HTML files. You can alter or add new MIME Types specifically for your site (Note: You cannot alter the system defined MIME Types values). MIME Types are often used to handle new technologies as they appear. When WAP technology first appeared, no one had these extensions set up on their server. With MIME Types, however, you could have set it up yourself and began serving WAP pages immediately. 
 
To learn more about MIME Types, view the WikiPedia web page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME. 
 
Creating A MIME Type 
 
1. Enter the MIME Type you want to create in the "Mime Type" text box. 
 
2. Enter the Extension of the MIME Type you entered in Step 1 above in the "Extension(s)" text box. 
 
3. Click on the "Add" button. 
Network Tools  
What are Network Tools? Network Tools allow a user to do the following: 
 
• Domain Lookup - Find information about a domain. This can be useful when making sure your DNS is set up properly. This feature provides a way for you to find out information about your IP address as well as your DNS entries. 
• Trace Route - Run a trace the route from the server your site is on to the computer you are accessing cPanel. The information shown will provide the number of servers and what servers your data must pass through to get to your site. 
 
Using Domain Lookup 
 
To use the "Domain Lookup" feature, enter the domain you want to lookup in the "Enter a domain to lookup" text box. Then click on the "Lookup" button. The next screen provides information about the domain you are looking up. 
 
Using The Trace Route 
 
Click on the "Trace" button. The next screen provides information about the trace route, including hops and number of milliseconds it took each hop during the route from your computer to the domain you are using cPanel.

Creating A MySQL Database  
What is a MySQL Database? MySQL databases allow you to store lots of information in an easy to access manner. The databases themselves are not easily read by humans. MySQL databases are required by many web applications including some bulletin boards, content management systems, and others. To use a database, you'll need to create it. Only MySQL Users (different than mail or other users) that have privileges to access a database can read from or write to that database. 
 
There are two ways to create a MySQL database The easiest way to create a MySQL database is to use the MySQL Database Wizard built directly into the cPanel interface. The second way involves a few more steps, but does not require you to go through the wizard. Make your selection below:

Domains 
Addon Domains  
What is an Addon Domain? An Addon Domain is similar to a subdomain and created in much the same way. An Addon Domain has its own file path, location, and file set that can be used to store a web site, images, documents or anything you want. It is almost like having your own web space for a different domain, but is attached to your main user account. This allows for easier management of the Addon Domain by being integrating and available from your main user account's management system. 
 
Note: If you are adding an addon domain, you can use a current subdomain by pointing the document root home to the same directory as the subdomain is located in. 
 
Creating Addon Domains  
 
1. Enter the domain name you want to use for the Addon Domain in the "New Domain Name" text box. 
 
2. When you place the cursor in the "Subdomain/Ftp Username" text box, cPanel automatically fills in the username and "Document Root home" text boxes for you. You can modify these to your specific needs, but generally the default entries created by the system will work. 
 
3. Enter any password you choose in the "Password" text box. The password can be anything and does not have to already exist. 
 
4. Click on the "Add Domain!" button. 
 
Notice: It may take a few minutes for the system to create your Addon Domain. Please be patient and do not click on any buttons while the system is working. 
 
5. The next page will state "ADDON_DOMAIN has been created!" The page will also display a link to the File Manager for you to manage the files for your new Addon Domain. To learn more about the File Manager, read the Using The File Manager document. Or you can click on the "Go Back" button to view your Addon Domain information (Proceed to Step 6 below to learn more). 
 
6. When the page loads, you will see a table with your newly created Addon Domain containing the following information, split into five columns:

Example: DomainB.com 
 
2. Click on the "Add Domain!" button. 
 
Note: Domains you "point" or "park" to the web hosting account you are currently managing MUST be registered with a valid registrar before they can be used. In addition, you need to point your domains to the DNS servers you are currently using for DomainA.com. Changing DNS server entries are accomplished by using your registrar's control panel. They cannot be modified using the cPanel interface. 
 
3. The next page will state "The parked domain DOMAIN_YOU_ARE_PARKING has been successfully created for you. 
 
4. Click on the "Go Back" button.

• Remove - Click on the "X" icon to remove the Parked Domain. When the next page loads, click on the "Yes" button to remove the Parked Domain. 
A confirmation page will display "The parked domain 
YOUR_PARKED_DOMAIN has been successfully removed."  
 
Redirects  
What are redirects? Redirects are used when you want to point a specific url or web page to another location. For example, you want your visitors to be 
redirected to DomainB.com/Order.HTML when they visit DomainA.Com/Sales.HTML. 
 
1. Select the type of redirect you want to create from the drop down menu. 
 
You have two choices: 
 
• Temporary - A permanent redirect will notify the visitor's browser to update any bookmarks that are linked to the page that is being redirected. 
• Permanent - Temporary redirects will not update the visitor's bookmarks. 
 
2. There will be two empty text boxes on the page. The first text box is following the root path of your current domain. Enter the path to the file you want to redirect in the first empty text box. 
 
Example: http://DomainA.com/Sales.HTML (Just enter Sales.HTML or the directory and filename you are redirecting.) 
 
Enter the domain name and path or url you want your visitor to be redirected to in the second empty text box. 
 
Example: http://DomainB.Com/Order.HTML (Just enter the domain name and directory/filename of the new location.)

Subdomains  
This section of the cPanel 11 manual will teach you everything you need to know about Subdomains. 
 
What is a subdomain? 
A subdomain is a domain using your main domain and a prefix name. As an example, let's say our main domain is cpx3demo.com. We want to create a domain for our support department and direct visitors to a separate area on our web site. Our subdomain would use "support" as the prefix and "cpx3demo.com" as the main domain. The example of putting these two together are shown below: 
 
Example: support.cpx3demo.com 
 
Consider a subdomain a url for any area on your web site. You can create the prefix as any name you want based on your own personal preferences. 
 
Creating A Subdomain 
 
1. Enter the prefix you want to use for the subdomain in the "Subdomain" text box. Based on our example above (support.cpx3demo.com), we would enter "support" as the "Subdomain" prefix. 
 
2. Once you place  your cursor in the "Document Root" text box, it will automatically fill in the location of your subdomain. cPanel will use the prefix you chose in Step 1 above and add it to the root path, ie. "public_html/PREFIX" or in our example, it would be "public_html/support." 
 
If you want to specify a particular location other than what cPanel automatically enters for you, modify the path according to your specific needs. 
 
3. Once you  have completed the above, click on the "Create" button. 
 
4. The next screen will indicate if your subdomain was created successfully. Click on the "Go Back" button to return to the previous page. 
 
5. When the page loads, you will see a table with your newly created subdomain containing the following information, split into five columns: 
 
• Subdomains - This entry will be the "Prefix" you chose in Step 1 above. 
• Root Domain - This entry will be the domain used when creating your subdomain. 
• Document Root - This entry will be the "Document Root" path created in Step 2 above. 
• Redirection - If you have setup a redirection on the subdomain you are viewing, the "Redirection" column will state "redirected to PATH YOU ENTERED." To learn how to setup redirection on your subdomain, view the Manage (Setup) Subdomain Redirection document. 
• Actions - You have two choices: 
• Manage Redirection - Click on this option to manage the redirection for the subdomain. 
• Remove - Click on this option to remove the subdomain from the system completely.   
 
 



 
Files 
Anonymous FTP Controls  
What are Anonymous FTP Controls? You can allow users to connect to your anonymous FTP directory without having a password to login. This may be useful if you have files that you wish to be publicly available for download. Anonymous FTP allows anyone to access a specified directory without a username or password. This means that anyone can access the files in your anonymous directory. Your anonymous directory is public_ftp/. 
 
NOTICE! Please note that allowing anonymous users to access any part of your system may be considered a security hole. 
 
1. The Anonymous FTP Controls page shows the following two check boxes: 
 
• Allow anonymous access to ftp://ftp.DOMAIN_NAME 
• Allow anonymous uploads to ftp://ftp.DOMAIN_NAME/incoming 
 
The first check box is to allow anonymous login to any directory for the associated domain. The second check box is to allow anonymous login to the "incoming" directory. You can check and uncheck each box according to your specific needs. 
 
2. Once you have finished modifying the Anonymous FTP Controls, click on the "Save Settings" button. 
 
3. You will see the following statement: 
 
"Updated!"

The Web Disk allows you to easily drag and drop files to your hosting account. 
You can create a Web Disk login and access your Web Disk below. Once your Web Disk is configured, you can then drag and drop files to it just like they are part of your home computer. You can also navigate through the files in your hosting account just as you do the files on your local computer. 
Web disks are relative to your account's home directory. The "house" icon signifies your home directory. 
 
By default, your cPanel account username will have a Web Disk login account already created. The default login gives you access to all directories in your web hosting account. To skip over how to create a web disk account, click on the "Access Web Disk" button in the "Access Web Disk" column. It should be the only entry in the "Web Disk Account Management" table shown at the bottom of the page. Also, you may want to read the Accessing and Using Web Disk section below. 
 
Create A Web Disk Login Account 
 
1. Enter the username you want to use for the new web disk account in the "Login" text box. 
 
2. Select the domain you want to use for the web disk account from the drop down menu. 
 
3. Enter the password you want to use for the web disk account in the "Password" text box. 
 
4. Once you place your cursor in the "Directory" text box, the system will automatically fill in the path to a directory using the "public_html" directory and the username you entered in Step 1 above. You can modify the directory path and name according to your own specific needs. However, if this is your first time using Web Disk, you may want to leave it as default until you are comfortable using the Web Disk feature in cPanel. 
 
5. Click on the "Create" button. 
 
6. You will see the following statement: 
 
"ACCOUNT_LOGIN has been given Web Disk access." 
 
7. Click on the "Go Back" link. 
 
8. When the page loads, you will see a four-column table consisting of the following information: 
 
• Login - This entry contains the login account username. 
• Directory - This entry contains the path to the directory associated with the Web Disk login account. 
• Access Web Disk - Click on the "Access Web Disk" button to use the "Web Disk" program. 
• Actions - The "Actions" column provides two features: 
• Change Password - Click on the "Change Password" link to modify and change the password for the associated Web Disk login account. 
• Delete - Click on the "Delete" link to remove the Web Disk login account from the system. 
 
Accessing and Using Web Disk 
 
1. When the page loads,  select the operating system you are using to view Web Disk from one of the available drop down menus.  
 
2. The "SSL" option is checked by default. If you prefer not to use a secure SSL connection, click on the "SSL (Recommended)" checkbox.  
 
3. Then click on the "Go" button. 
 
4. Follow the on-screen instructions for accessing Web Disk based on the operation system you chose in Step 1 above. Each operating system has its own set of instructions for accessing Web Disk. If you have problems or need further assistance accessing Web Disk from your computer, please contact your hosting provider's support department. 
Viewing Disk Space Usage  
Why view disk space usage? 
The cPanel Disk Usage Viewer allows you to see where the files are in your site that are taking up disk space. You can use the viewer to view all of the files in your site and find out how much space each file takes up. Please note that this number does not include files outside your home directory. This will show a different usage number than the statistics on the main screen of your interface. 
 
When the disk space usage page loads, it will default to the root directory of your web hosting account. There are several options you can choose on the page: 
 
• Decrease Depth - Click on this button to show fewer directories. The system will not expand and extend into directories, giving you a more top level view of your directories and their associated disk space usage values. 
• Increase Depth - Click on this button to show more directories. The system will expand and extend into directories, giving you a more in-depth view of your directories and their associated disk space usage values. 
• Delete Selected - You can delete directories directly from this page by clicking on the checkbox in the "Select: All, None" column for the associated directory. Once you  have made your selections, click on the "Delete Selected" link. 
 
Actions 
  
• Show Top Parent Directories - Select this option from the "Actions" column to display only the parent directories in the root directory.

• Clear File Usage Cache - Select this option to clear the disk space usage values from the screen. 
• Hide Small Files - Select this option to not show files that are smaller in size. 
• Show File Sizes as Bytes - Select this option to show file size values in bytes instead of megabytes in the "Size (MB)" column. 
 
The page shows a three-column table consisting of the following information: 
 
• Directory - This entry shows the path to the directory based on the option you choose above. You can click on any of the path links to ascend into any of the directories. 
• Size (MB) - This entry shows the value in megabytes of the associated directory. You can change the displayed value from megabytes to bytes 
by selecting the "Show File Sizes as Bytes" in the "Actions" drop down menu as described in the "Actions" section above. 
• Select: All, None - Click on any of the checkboxes in this column and then select from one of the "Actions" drop down menu as described in the "Actions" section above. 
 
At the bottom of the page is a total in megabytes of the file space being used for ONLY the directories being shown on the page. If you ascend into a directory, the total in megabytes value will change.

To learn about the SquirrelMail web based email client, visit the web site at http://www.squirrelmail.org/. 
Configure Mail Client  
You can easily configure a mail client to use any of your email accounts using the cPanel interface. 
 
What is a mail client? 
A mail client is an application you use to check your email. The mail client can be either web based or a desktop application such as Microsoft Outlook or Express. 
 
Why configure my mail client? 
You can configure your mail client to receive emails from any account you setup through cPanel. For example, if you use Microsoft Outlook and want to configure the application to receive and send emails from an account created in cPanel, you can set cPanel to automatically configure your Microsoft Outlook for you. 
 
1. Find the email account you want to use when configuring your mail client in the "Current Accounts" table. 
 
2. Select the "Configure Mail Client" option from the drop down menu in the "Functions" column. 
 
3. There are two ways to configure your mail client. You can use the "AutoConfigure" options or manually adjust the settings using the information provided in your control panel. 
 
Note: You can only use the "Auto-Configure" options for the following mail clients: 
 
• Microsoft Outlook 
• Microsoft Outlook Express 
• Mac Mail.app 
 
Also note that you can choose between IMAP and POP3 when configuring your mail client. Definitions are shown below: 
 
IMAP: IMAP email access coordinates between the server and you mail application. Messages that have been read/deleted/replied-to will show as read/deleted/replied-to both on the server and in the mail application.  
   
You can learn more about IMAP through Wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol. 
 
POP3: POP3 does not coordinate with the server. Messages marked as read/deleted/replied-to in the mail application will not show as read/deleted/replied-to on the server. This means that future downloads of your inbox or other mailboxes with POP3 will show all messages as unread.  
 
You can learn more about POP3 through Wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol. 
Auto-Configure Option 
Click on one of the "Auto-Configure" options according to the mail client and type you want to use. In our example we chose the "Auto-Configure Microsoft Outlook for POP3 Access" option. A new pop-up message will appear stating what the control panel is going to do in order to automatically configure the mail client you chose. cPanel will modify your registry settings and configure your mail client. Follow any additional on-screen prompts in order to complete the process. 
Manually Configuring Your Email Client 
The following settings are predetermined for you in your control panel based on the email account you chose in Step 3 above: 
 
• Mail Server Username 
• Incoming Mail Server 	Outgoing Mail Server 
• Supported Incoming Mail Protocols 
• Supported Outgoing Mail Protocols 
 
If you need assistance manually configuring your mail client, ask your system administrator for more information. 
Create A Mailing List  
What is a mailing list? A mailing list can simplify sending messages to a large group of people. You can add a group of email addresses to a mailing list to avoid typing in those addresses each time a mailing is sent.

Email Verification (BoxTrapper)  
What is BoxTrapper? 
BoxTrapper protects your Inbox from spam by forcing all people not on your white list to reply to a verification email before they can send mail to you. This is an effective way to make sure only people you "approve" can send you email. Spam will not be able to enter your Inbox without prior approval from you as the white list manager.

• verify - This confirmation message is the first email to be sent to someone when they first send you an email. You must leave the "verify#%msgid%" variable exactly as it appears in the "Subject" line in order for this 
confirmation message to work properly. It is also a good idea to leave the "%email%" variable in the "To" line in order to validate the email address being used. Click on the "Save" button after you have modified the "verify" confirmation email. 
• blacklist - If you deny an email address verification, the sender will receive the blacklist message stating that you are not accepting emails from the sender's email address. You can  modify the message to your specific needs. Variables used include (%email%, %subject%, %acct%, and %headers%). Click on the "Save" button after you have modified the "blacklist" confirmation email. 
• returnverify - This confirmation message sends an email to the sender's email address stating that you have approved their email address for sending email to your email account.

• Forward List - The forward list is a list of email address where white listed and verified mail should be sent to in addition to the address BoxTrapper is protecting. 
• White List - The white list is a list of content that will be allowed into your inbox with a confirmation. The list should contain one entry per line. Entries should be in the format of a perl regular expression. For example: john@domain.com would be john\@domain\.com and all addresses at domain.com would be .+\@domain\.com 
• Ignore List - The ignore list is a list of users or subjects to prevent from emailing you. The list should contain one entry per line. Entries should be in the format of a perl regular expression. For example: john@domain.com would be john\@domain\.com and all addresses at domain.com would be .+\@domain\.com 
• Black List - The black list is a list of content to prevent emailing you. The sender of black listed content will also receive a warning message of your choice. The list should contain one entry per line. Entries should be in the format of a perl regular expression.

Change Password  
You can change the main password to your web hosting account. Before you begin, make sure you have closed all windows that are currently open and associated with your control panel. 
 
NOTICE! PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE CHANGING YOUR PASSWORD! 
 
Protect your password: 
Don't write down your password, memorize it. In particular, don't write it down and leave it anywhere, and don't place it in an unencrypted file! Use unrelated passwords for systems controlled by different organizations. Don't give or share your password, in particular to someone claiming to be from computer support or a vendor unless you are sure they are who they say they are. Don't let anyone watch you enter your password. Don't enter your password on a computer you don't trust. Use the password for a limited time and change it periodically.  
 
Choose a hard-to-guess password: 
Our system will try to prevent you from choosing a really bad password, but it isn't foolproof; create your password wisely. Don't use something you'd find in a dictionary (in any language or jargon). Don't use a name (including that of a spouse, parent, child, pet, fantasy character, famous person, or location) or any variation of your personal or account name. Don't use accessible information about you or your environment, such as your phone number, license plate or social security number. Don't use a birthday or a simple pattern, such as backwards, followed by a digit, or proceeded by a digit. Instead, use a mixture of upper and lower case letters, as well as digits or punctuation. When choosing a new password, make sure it's unrelated to any previous password. Use long passwords (say 8 characters long). You might use a word pair with punctuation inserted, a pass phrase (an understandable sequence of words), or the first letter of each word in a pass phrase. 
 
Changing Your Password 
 
1. Enter your current password in the "Old Password" text box. 
 
2. Enter your new password in the "New Password" text box.

The public and private key are similar to a puzzle. They are created together to use during the login/authentication process. The public key resides on the server (the remote location) The private key resides locally on your computer/server. 
When you attempt to login to a server, the public and private key are compared. If they "match", then you will be allowed to login to the server location. 
 
You can download the private/public keys here and import into PuTTY (or other SSH clients) if you prefer using something else for SSH connections. Or, if you have been using PuTTY, you can import the public/private keys by click on Import Key. You can also download your key in PuTTY's ppk format under View/Download.
